**More about me**  
I am a geo and spatial science graduate student, Debian GNU\Linux user,
open-source advocate, runner and dog lover. I did my undergraduate in
environmental science with a focus in geography and zoology, I further
specialized in Geography and I am currently busy with my master of science
degree with a focus on severe weather forecasting. I'm navigating this
strange new world of programming, blogging and sharing. Bare with me.
