Running has become a big part of my life, it has allowed me to see new
places and meet new people, many of who are now my close friends.  I
currently have a [Garmin Forerunner
630](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/516105/pn/010-03717-00) that I use
to track my runs, the watch itself is pretty cool, I post all my activities
to [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3278392), there's a cool maps
with details about altitude, pace, distance, etc..
