In 2013 I started using Ubuntu to run The Weather Research
and Forecasting Model (WRF) for my final year project. Although
I wasn’t to keen I found it really cool. The command line was
mythical for me back then. It wasn’t until 2016 that I finally
decided to get rid of Windows and just run GNU\Linux. Initially
I started with Ubuntu LTS and soon I stumbled on Ubuntu Gnome
and I really loved the environment. I _distro hopped_ for
a while, if I I probably reinstalled my system every week for
about two months. I installed Debian somewhere there and after
changing it to testing I was hooked. The system was more stable
than any release I ever had. Currently have computers running
Debian testing, a Dell E6220 with Gnome 3 and a small Acer Netbook
with Mate I use when I travel. Both systems have not let me down
and despite the testing tag both have been very stable.
