In 2013 I started using Ubuntu to run The Weather Research and
Forecasting Model (WRF) for my final year project. Although I wasn't too
keen I found it really cool. The command line was mythical for me back
then. It wasn't until 2016 that I finally decided to get rid of Windows
and just run GNU\Linux. Initially I started with Ubuntu LTS and soon I found
Ubuntu Gnome and I really loved the environment. Then I started disto
hopping, if I think back I probably reinstalled my system every week
for about two months. I installed Debian somewhere there and after changing
it to testing I was hooked. The system was more stable then any release
I ever had. Currently have computers running Debian testing, my primary pc a
Dell E6220 i7 with Gnome 3 and a small Acer netbook with Mate I use when I travel.
