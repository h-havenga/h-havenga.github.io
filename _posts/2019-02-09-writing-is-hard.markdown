I started this blog with noble intentions, which I still have, but looking at
the date of my last post I am embarrassed by my commitment to it. It's not that
I've lost interest, it's more a case of very bad *imposter syndrome* that came
over me and particularly my writing style. But as with everything I should see
this as practise. The only way to get better is to write more and write
regularly, otherwise you *get out of shape*. That's the same with reading,
exercising, meditating or anything else. The book **Writer's Home Companion: An
Anthology of the World's Best Writing Advice, From Keats to Kunitz, _Joan
Bolker_ ** makes the same argument and suggest writing exercises by using cues.
Or just even writing randomly for a set time each day about anything that comes
up in your mind. So this post is a little commitment to myself to *just write*.
No matter how bad, or how random, I just need to write.

Ps. I also write in everything directly in vim without any fancy spell or
grammar checker, that kind of makes this a very raw read in a sense.
