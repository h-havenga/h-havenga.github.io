The Integrated Radiosonde Archive is a great online database containing
radiosonde data from around the world, even better is that there is a
already derived dataset with some interesting variables like CAPE, CIN, LI,
SI, TTI and more waiting for someone to use it in some fancy plot
(hopefully for publication one day). All credit to the maintainers of this
database. It’s really well kept up.

The data was pretty useful in evaluation of some trends associated with
severe storms. Some interesting things stand out (maybe this is my
contribution to science, I think most of it is already well known anyway).
We were able to see that there is a increase to an atmosphere favoring
convective storms over the last 40 years – do I hear the words “global
warming” somewhere? The only index that did not indicate this was the
Totals Totals (TT) index… Why, well I’m not sure yet… In due time, I’ll let
you know. So yes, the environment seems to favor more convective storms
(take note) over the highveld of South-Africa.

When I finish my thesis I’ll publish some figures here of my findings.

GNUPLOT, cool for plotting raw data… I actually wrote the original title
long before I wrote this. I stopped using GNUPLOT and switched to R (I’m to
stupid to do complicated stats with GNUPLOT). I did however find it useful
to plot raw time series data quickly. The other tool that I started using
and which I find really cool is GMT or Generic Mapping Tools, I use it to
make nice maps, it’s pretty easy and the quality is great. The learning
curve is quite steep but worth it. You can also do statistics with gnuplot
if you’re smarter then me!
