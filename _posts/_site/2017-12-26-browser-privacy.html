<p>I am of the opinion that most of what we do on a computer occurs in our browser
these days, anything from banking, shopping, connecting, reading and learning
all occurs within this one box.</p>

<h4 id="my-browser">My browser</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is my daily browser. I like
their open-source commitment and I’ve never had any major issues, I’m sure I’ll
switch without any guilt if that changes. I’m also a big fan of Firefox Focus
for mobile browsing. A browser that has caught my attention is
<a href="https://qutebrowser.org/">Qutebrowser</a>, its characteristic feature is the vim
like key-bindings, maybe in the future I’ll use it a little more.</p>

<h4 id="my-add-ons">My add-ons</h4>
<p>Attempting to balance privacy with usability is hard, websites break without
much effort if you use tracking and add blocking tools or the wrong combination
of them. However I have found the following to not ruin my experience at all.
I have three main add-ons that I advocate everyone to use without thinking about
it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">uBlock Origin</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Block annoying ads and can prevent WebRTC leak IP leak without going into 
  <em>about:config</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you connect to a site using the encrypted https protocol</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Detect and prevent tracking</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some more obscure add-ons I’ve added, which may be overkill, include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://decentraleyes.org/">Decentraleyes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://add0n.com/popup-blocker.html">Popup Blocker</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/">CanvasBlocker</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Along with this I set my browser to never remember passwords or autofill forms
(I use a password manager for this), to only accept cookies from sites
I visited, and I also enable Tracking Prevention while Do Not Track Request is
on. Firefox can be further customized by entering the <em>about:config</em>,
I recommend reading trough <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/#">Privacy Tools</a>
before configuring settings here, some settings make the browsing experience
a little less convenient or break websites. Of course you can use
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> if you’re really paranoid, but this
post is probably not for you if you reach that level.</p>
