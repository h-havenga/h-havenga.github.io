<p>I recently downloaded Ubuntu on a new pc for my family, in my quest to convince
them of the <em>usefulness</em> of Linux, I wrote a little script for them to use when
downloading photos from their cameras instead of going through the tedious
process of clicking a mouse 25 times. If my attempts to actually get them into
the Linux system works is another question.</p>

<span class="c">#This is a quick and dirty Canon EOS download script from the SD card reader</span>

<span class="c">#Name of file = download date</span>
<span class="nv">date</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>date +%Y_%m_%d<span class="k">)</span>

cowsay <span class="nt">-f</span> gnu <span class="s2">"Welcome"</span>

<span class="nb">read</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> <span class="s2">"Photos will be saved under Pictures/</span><span class="nv">$date</span><span class="s2">/70D. Press ENTER to continue "</span>

<span class="c">#Make directory</span>
mkdir <span class="nt">-p</span> ~/Pictures/<span class="nv">$date</span>/70D

<span class="c">#Copy photos to new directory, when done open directory</span>
cp <span class="nt">--verbose</span> /media/ubuntu/EOS_DIGITAL/DCIM/100CANON/<span class="k">*</span> ~/Pictures/<span class="nv">$date</span>/70D

cowsay <span class="nt">-f</span> gnu <span class="s2">"All Done"</span>

<span class="nb">read</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> <span class="s2">"Photos saved to /Pictures/</span><span class="nv">$date</span><span class="s2">/70D. Press ENTER to open the folder "</span>

nautilus ~/Pictures/<span class="nv">$date</span>/70D <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span>

<span class="nb">exit </span>0</code></pre></figure>

<p>To make the file an desktop shortcut was actually more effort then I thought.
You have to create the following in the Desktop directory under something like
Canon_Downloads.desktop and add the following to its contents</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] <br />
Name=70D_Photo_Download<br />
Comment=Download RWFL photos from Canon 70D <br />
Exec=bash -c ‘~/Programs/bash_scripts/GetPhotos70D.sh’<br />
Icon=utilities-terminal<br />
Terminal=true<br />
Type=Application<br />
Categories=Application<br />
Name=70D_Photo_Download</p>

<p>The last think is to make sure both the bash and the .desktop is executable. To
make a executable just do</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">chmod +x inputfile</code></pre></figure>

<p>And now it’s just a double click away</p>
