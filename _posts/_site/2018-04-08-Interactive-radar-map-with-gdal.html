<p>This post builds on the previous post. As you’ve seen the image from Titan is
a static map of the radar coverage. To improve the map we wanted something
interactive where you can zoom and all that fancy stuff. I made a map with my
favorite tool, yes you guessed right, GMT, however it was still a static map so
no luck there. Next I explored some online options, the easiest was Mapbox.
However, it was not that easy. I actually have to lay out the whole Radar -&gt;
Webserver process to underline how not so easy it is to get workable data, and
by workable data I mean netCDF files and if you think netCDF is an easy file
format to work with, think again.</p>

<p>Without going into to detail about the radar itself, the process of getting the
current static image is something like this:</p>

<p><em>Magnetron Generates Pulse -&gt; Radar
Echos -&gt; Receiver Converts -&gt; Titan Processes -&gt; P2P 1 -&gt; P2P 2 -&gt; P2P 3 -&gt;
Local Server -&gt; Webserver -&gt; Lekwena Website</em></p>

<p>Not a lot of room for error you see (I’m kidding, there’s a lot of room for
errors and we experience them all).</p>

<p>The data is also not netCDF, it’s MDV data. What’s MDV data, well I don’t know
but that’s what Titan gives us. Lucky for me there’s a Mdv2netcdf script in the
software so it’s possible to transform the data to something I can work with.</p>

<p>Back to mapbox, after doing the whole Mdv2netcdf I hoped I could natively import 
the netcdf file without hassle. Apparently not, the fix was relatively easy.
Mapbox takes GEOtiff files and I remembered using <strong>gdal_translate</strong> for something
in the past and after a very quick Google I did:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gdal_translate radarin.nc radarout.tif</code></pre></figure>

<p>and this gave me a very gray image</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/radar/output.jpg" alt="gray_radar" /></p>

<p>Although not ideal, the tif image can be imported into Mapbox and it works, but
a gray radar image makes no sense and it’s hard to distinguish dBz. Using
<strong>gdalinfo</strong> you can inspect the tif or original netcdf file and you’ll see it
only has one band representing dBz. To actually make a color map of dBz
I figured out you have to use <strong>gdaldem</strong>. First you have to make a color palette
and according to gdal’s website <em>“Since GDAL 1.8.0, GMT .cpt palette files are
also supported (COLOR_MODEL = RGB only).”</em>. Anyway I didn’t use a cpt but it’s nice to
know.</p>

<p>So after creating your palette, run gdaldem:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gdaldem color-relief nc20171230_000123.nc <span class="nt">-alpha</span> radar_pal.txt <span class="nt">-of</span> GTiff outfile.tiff</code></pre></figure>

<p>and look what a nice image we have, all colorful and everything. However it is
still static</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/radar/outfile.jpg" alt="gray_radar" /></p>

<p>With this overflow of gdal knowledge in me I discovered <strong>gdal2tiles</strong>. 
Possibly the best discovery yet. Now I did not need Mapbox anymore, I figured
I can create my own interactive map without the need to register some place.</p>

<p>Using <strong>gdal2tiles</strong> is as easy as</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gdal2tiles.py <span class="nt">-z</span> 5-10 outfile.tiff</code></pre></figure>

<p>and now we have a really cool map (click on the layer tab in the map), which we are currently experimenting with before we put
it on the lekwenaradar website hosted on github. Best of all it seems to work :)</p>

<p>Now our chain gets a bit more links which means more places for possible
failure, but we have a way cooler map. To revisit the process:</p>

<p><em>Magnetron Generates Pulse -&gt; Radar Echos -&gt; Receiver Converts -&gt; Titan
Processes -&gt; P2P 1 -&gt; P2P 2 -&gt; P2P 3 -&gt; Local Server -&gt; Mdv2netcdf -&gt;
gdal_translate -&gt; gdaldem -&gt; gdal2tiles -&gt; Webserver -&gt; Lekwena Website</em></p>

<p>All in a day’s work</p>
