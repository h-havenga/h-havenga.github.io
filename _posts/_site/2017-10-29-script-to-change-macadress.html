<p>Every network card has a mac address, a serial number of sorts,
assigned to it by which a network can identify you. It is a widely
used way to restrict or monitor your access on a network and it could
be useful in such cases to have a randomly assigned mac address to
improve your privacy and anonymity.  The script is just a bunch a of
commands, you can run them separately if you want to, this just makes
it easier to reuse instead of remembering every step. The mac address
should change with every reconnect.</p>
