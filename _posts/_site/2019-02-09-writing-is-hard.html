<p>I started this blog with noble intentions, which I still have, but looking at
the date of my last post I am embarrassed by my commitment to it. It’s not that
I’ve lost interest, it’s more a case of very bad <em>imposter syndrome</em> that came
over me and particularly my writing style. But as with everything I should see
this as practise. The only way to get better is to write more and write
regularly, otherwise you <em>get out of shape</em>. That’s the same with reading,
exercising, meditating or anything else. The book, Writer’s Home Companion: An
Anthology of the World’s Best Writing Advice, From Keats to Kunitz by <em>Joan
Bolker</em> , the author makes the same argument and suggest writing exercises by using cues.
Or just even writing randomly for a set time each day about anything that comes
up in your mind. So this post is a little commitment to myself to <em>just write</em>.
No matter how bad, or how random, I just need to write.</p>

<p>Ps. I also write in everything directly in vim without any fancy spell or
grammar checker, that kind of makes this a very raw read in a sense.</p>
