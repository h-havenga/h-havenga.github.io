<p>This is a very simple script I made that allows me to edit my website
locally, build it locally and as soon as I am satisfied I can push it to my
Github account. After this is completed it takes a couple of minutes for
the site to be updated. For it to work you have to have a Github account
and also go through the whole process of pulling and pushing, detailed
