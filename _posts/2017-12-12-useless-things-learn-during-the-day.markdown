Everyday I figure out small things that make life a little easier and don't fit
in my *useful one liners* post , I tend to forget them the moment I'm done
using it or implementing whatever I need it for. This could be anything from
latex to git to bash to vim and in most cases these are just little
conveniences. So I'll attempt to note these useless things here. 

### Adding Metadata to LaTeX pdf
This whole post was inspired by right clicking on my thesis and seeing that my
metadata is empty, the fix was pretty easy. Add this to your preamble:

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
    pdftitle={LaTeX is for cool kids},
    pdfsubject={Not Computer Science},
    pdfauthor={Henno Havenga},
    pdfkeywords={LaTeX, VIM, Debian, GNU, Linux}
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Plotting a tif file with GMT 
I needed to clip a [NASA Blue
Marble](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_cat.php?categoryID=1484) tif file.
I wanted to use *gdal_tanslate* but a not so quick search yield
[*gdalwarp*](https://joeyklee.github.io/broc-cli-geo/guide/XX_raster_cropping_and_clipping.html)
as a simpler option. Also note that the default NASA projection is Plate CarrÃ©e
(JQ in GMT), this is useful to know if you want to draw borders over the NASA
data using GMT without thinking to much about conversions. To clip the data
I used gdalwarp and then GMT's psimage module to overlay the image on a map:

{% highlight bash %}
gdalwarp -te 15 59 38 71 blue_marble_infile.tif clipped_blue_marble_outfile.tif
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
gmt psbasemap -R15/38/59/71.5 -JQ20 -Xc -Yc -B5a0 -V -K > image_map.ps
gmt psimage clipped_blue_marble_outfile.tif -DjCM+w20/11.1 -R -J -O -K -V >> image_map.ps
{% endhighlight %}
