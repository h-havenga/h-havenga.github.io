# Unpaved roads I've driven on

I have a very cool Land Rover Defender, and I frequently find myself on
gravel roads. I hate the rush on the pavement and the Defender just _"feels at
home"_ on unpaved roads. I decided to make this map as a result, it's a fun
exercise for me and I find it interesting to see where I've been.

##### Red: bad roads || Yellow: so-so || Green: pretty nice to drive on
