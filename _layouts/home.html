    <div id="left"> <p align="justify">Welcome dear reader, if you
    don't know <i>howzit</i> is South-African slang for <i>how are
    you</i> or <i>what's up</i>. Even more South-African would be to
    say <i>Howzit China</i>, yes like China the country.  Something
    you may know is that I'm Henno and on the right you can see me
    running in the beautiful woods of Finland. Apart from running,
    what could considered an unhealthy amount, I study the atmosphere
    and the interesting processes in it.  I'm particularly fascinated
    by severe weather and the impact it has on socio-economics. My
    studies have allowed me access to some cool technological stuff,
    this has led me to become an avid GNU\Linux user and I've started
    learning some programming languages, while not an expert by any
    means I have an inquisitive nature and I'm a very avid learner.
    My interests spread beyond these things obviously. I don't
    question your motives for being here. If you just Googled me you
    can find some topics here to bring up during a conversation and I
    sincerely hope you like what you see.<p> 

    <p align="justify"><b>Disclaimer</b>. This blog was created in the
    hope to my share my data, code, knowledge (or lack thereof) and
    get critiqued in the process. I will post some personal viewpoints
    here, random scripts that you should never use (I don't take any
    responsibility for what you do with my useless code) and you
    should never take me seriously.<p> 
    
    <p align="justify"> This site was created using Jekyll and Github,
    you can literally clone the site as is and host it yourself if you
    want to, but that would not be nice. Be original.</p>
