	<p align="justify">Welcome dear reader, as you may have noticed I'm Henno. 
	On the right you can see me running in the beautiful woods of Finland.
	Apart from running, what could considered an unhealthy amount, I
	study the atmosphere and the interesting processes in it.
	I'm particularly fascinated by severe weather and the impact it has
	on socio-economics. My studies have allowed me access to some
	cool technological stuff, this has led me to become an avid GNU\Linux
	user and I've started learning some programming languages, while
	not an expert by any means, I do have an inquisitive nature and maybe 
	a little OCD, which helps. My interests spread beyond these things
	obviously. I don't question your motives for being here. If you're
	a spy agency feel free to contact me personally, if you just Googled me
	you can find some topics here to bring up during a conversation
	and just overall I hope you like what you see.<p> 

	<p align="justify">This blog was created in the hope to my share my data,
        code, knowledge (or lack thereof) and get critiqued in the process. I will
	post some personal viewpoints here, don't take me too seriously. I'm a
	nice guy in real life, I like beer and puppies. Be aware that you are only
	getting a glimpse into snippets my life, I would not recommend drawing too
	many conclusions about me here. <p>
